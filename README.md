# Wellcome to my  MathUtil project

This project contains two methods to calculate the factorial (n!): one using brute force and the other using recursion. The MathUtil class is designed with static assets, allowing for their use without the need to create a new object each time.

## You will find in this repo:

* NetBeans Apache Ant project including JUnit Test
* .gitignore file for NetBeans project
* README.md - this file itself - using Markdown language
